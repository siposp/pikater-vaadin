		Argh! Newer versions of GWT compiler seem to assume that all files
		included by 'source' element should be compiled! Be VERY aware of
		this because unless you compile with "-logLevel DEBUG", you won't
		see any errors generated by the compilation of your widgetset. And
		even though errors occur, they won't stop the compilation...
		
		Like it would be SO troublesome to simply:
		- compile files transitively referenced from the module's own package,
		- introduce a "force include tag" in case something is not referenced...
		
		Seriously, Google... You can do a lot better than that :S.
